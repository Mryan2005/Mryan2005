I'm Mryan2005, When I was young, I was taught how to use computers by my dad.From that time, I interest in computers and I teach myself to develope software. Now, I study in SSPU.

I don't know why I love developing software, maybe it is interest.Nut now, I have set foot on the way to be a excellent developer, and I am still walking on this road.

I like playing Minecraft, but now I seldom do it.

if you went to fall in love with me, I may be a wonderful and excellent destoryor, destorying our relationship because I will think you give me up if  you don't sent a massage to me.
