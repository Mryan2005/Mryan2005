## Who I am

I am Mryan2005. My real name is Zhizhong Yan, and when I was young I was taught how to use computers by my dad. From that point on, I became interested in computers and taught myself to develop software. Now, I am studying at SSPU.

I have no idea why I love developing software. Maybe it's because I have an interest in computers, or I like to live lazily. But you know, when you go to live in idleness, you need a lot of things to be ready for it, and so do I.

Now, I am on my way to becoming a good developer, and I am still on my way.

I love playing Minecraft, but now I rarely do.

Haibara Ai, whom I loved so much, was so perfect that she caught my eye, and she was my goddess, but I loved her because we had some similar experiences. I still remember that when Detective Conan Movie 26: Black Iron Submarine was released, I couldn't wait to see her, and posted the moment when I was watching the movie, someone who didn't know Haibara Ai was the role of Detective Conan may have thought she was my girlfriend. To be honest, I did not like the CP about Edogawa Conan and Haibara Ai. If Haibara Ai marries Conan, I think, as the saying goes, to learn from Conan, to be Conan, to surpass Conan.

If you were going to fall in love with me, I might be a wonderful, excellent Wreck-It Ralph to ruin our relationship, because I would think you were giving me up if you did not send me a message.
