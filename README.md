## Who I am

I'm Mryan2005, When I was young, I was taught how to use computers by my dad. From that time, I interest in computers and I teach myself to develope software. Now, I study in SSPU.

I don't know why I love developing software, maybe because I have interest in  computer or I like living lazily. but you know, when you went to live lazily, you need to a lot of things to prepare it, me too.

now, I have set foot on the way to be a excellent developer, and I am still walking on this road.

I like playing Minecraft, but now I seldom do it.

Haibara Ai, who I love a lot, is so perfect that she catches my attention, and she is my goddress, but the reason why I love her is that we have some similar experiences. I still remember that when Detective Conan Movie 26 was released, I couldn't wait to see her, and posted the moment when I was watching the movie, someone who didn't know Haibara Ai was the role of Detective Conan may have thought she was my girlfriend. Speaking truely, I don't like the CP which is Edogawa Conan and Haibara Ai. If it is true, It will be a sad story that I can't fall in love with Haibara Ai.

if you went to fall in love with me, I may be a wonderful and excellent destoryor, destorying our relationship because I will think you give me up if  you don't sent a massage to me.
