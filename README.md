## Introduce myself in Python

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, realname, School, currentPosition, hobbies):
    self.realname = realname
    self.School = School
    self.currentPosition = currentPosition
    self.hobbies = hobbies

## Who I am

I am Mryan2005. My real name is Zhizhong Yan, and when I was young, my dad taught me how to use computers. Since then, I have developed a keen interest in computers and taught myself software development. Currently, I am studying at SSPU.

I have no idea why I love developing software. Maybe it's because I have an interest in computers, or I like to live lazily, but you know, when you go to live in idleness, you need a lot of things to be ready for it, and so do I.

Recently, I've been diving into coding and working towards becoming a proficient developer. I'm still making progress on my journey to achieve that goal.

I used to be really into playing Minecraft, but these days I hardly ever get the chance to do it.

Haibara Ai, whom I loved so much, is so perfect that she fascinates me, and she was my goddess, but I loved her because we had some similar things, for example, we buy some established brands products. I still remember that when Detective Conan Movie 26: Black Iron Submarine was released, I couldn't wait to see her, and posted the moment when I was watching the movie, someone who didn't know Haibara Ai was the role of Detective Conan may have thought she was my girlfriend.

now, I like a new role whose name is Venti, from Genshin. My GitHub avatar was taken when I was cosplaying him, but the coiffure is not like him, because I'm not able to make the coiffure which is like him by only myself.

If you were going to fall in love with me, I might be a wonderful, excellent Wreck-It Ralph to ruin our relationship, because I would think you were giving me up if you did not send me a message.

Finally, there's a saying that It's not about being born extraordinary, but daring to be extraordinary. The era requires us, it needs pioneers like us, to break through, to change, to create. I will keep pushing boundaries in the futhure.

## What I wish

I wish many, many, many GitHub friends can follow my GitHub because of my codes instead of other things, but I know my coding ability is a bit poor, and I often write some codes and some projects, those things look so stupid, and they makes my wish looks like a fantasy story. All right! Despite all this, I believe that I can be a wonderful programmer in the near future.
