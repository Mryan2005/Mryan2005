## Who I am

I am Mryan2005. My real name is Zhizhong Yan, and when I was young, my dad taught me how to use computers. Since then, I have developed a keen interest in computers and taught myself software development. Currently, I am studying at SSPU.

I have no idea why I love developing software. Maybe it's because I have an interest in computers, or I like to live lazily, but you know, when you go to live in idleness, you need a lot of things to be ready for it, and so do I.

Recently, I've been diving into coding and working towards becoming a proficient developer. I'm still making progress on my journey to achieve that goal.

I used to be really into playing Minecraft, but these days I hardly ever get the chance to do it.

Haibara Ai, whom I loved so much, is so perfect that she fascinates me, and she was my goddess, but I loved her because we had some similar things, for example, we buy some established brands products. I still remember that when Detective Conan Movie 26: Black Iron Submarine was released, I couldn't wait to see her, and posted the moment when I was watching the movie, someone who didn't know Haibara Ai was the role of Detective Conan may have thought she was my girlfriend. To be honest, I did not like the CP about Edogawa Conan and Haibara Ai. If Haibara Ai marries Conan, I think, as the saying goes, to learn from Conan, to be Conan, to surpass Conan.

If you were going to fall in love with me, I might be a wonderful, excellent Wreck-It Ralph to ruin our relationship, because I would think you were giving me up if you did not send me a message.

Finally, there's a saying that It's not about being born extraordinary, but daring to be extraordinary. The era requires us, it needs pioneers like us, to break through, to change, to create. I will keep pushing boundaries in the futhure.
